# Blockchain-Based Specialized Gemstone Certification

A decentralized platform for authenticating, certifying, and tracking valuable gemstones throughout their lifecycle.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create immutable, transparent certification records for precious and semi-precious gemstones. Through four specialized smart contracts, the platform enables reliable verification of gemstone characteristics, laboratory testing, treatment disclosures, and ownership history, solving persistent problems of fraud and misrepresentation in the gemstone market.

## Core Components

### 1. Stone Registration Contract

Records essential details of valuable gemstones:
- Unique gemstone identifier generation
- Physical characteristics (weight, dimensions, color)
- Origin documentation and mine-to-market tracking
- High-resolution imagery and 3D scans
- Mineralogical classification
- Rarity indicators and notable features
- Initial valuation metrics

### 2. Laboratory Verification Contract

Validates scientific testing and professional grading:
- Accredited laboratory verification
- Gemological assessment results
- Color grading and certification
- Clarity evaluation and documentation
- Cut quality and proportions analysis
- Spectroscopic and chemical composition data
- Fluorescence and phosphorescence properties
- Independent appraiser confirmations

### 3. Treatment Disclosure Contract

Documents enhancements and modifications:
- Heat treatment records
- Irradiation processes
- Clarity enhancement procedures
- Color diffusion treatments
- Fracture filling documentation
- Surface coating applications
- Oil/resin impregnation disclosure
- Treatment permanence evaluation
- Before/after comparison data

### 4. Ownership Transfer Contract

Tracks custody changes and transaction history:
- Secure ownership transfer mechanisms
- Transaction verification and validation
- Custody history with timestamp proof
- Export/import documentation
- Insurance record integration
- Secure escrow capabilities
- Anti-theft registry connection
- Private and public ownership options

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain network
- Node.js v16.0+
- Truffle Suite v5.0+
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- IPFS for decentralized storage of gemological reports and imagery

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemstone-certification.git
   cd gemstone-certification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy to your preferred network:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network [network-name]
   ```

## Usage

### For Miners and Producers

1. Register newly extracted gemstones
2. Document origin and extraction methods
3. Initiate the certification process
4. Transfer to cutting and processing facilities with secure tracking

### For Gemological Laboratories

1. Create verifiable laboratory reports
2. Upload spectroscopic and testing data
3. Issue grading certifications
4. Document any treatments detected
5. Link physical certificates to blockchain records

### For Dealers and Retailers

1. Verify complete gemstone history
2. Access laboratory certifications
3. Confirm treatment disclosures
4. Register new ownership transfers
5. Generate transparency reports for customers

### For Collectors and Consumers

1. Verify gemstone authenticity before purchase
2. Access complete provenance and certification history
3. Confirm treatment status with confidence
4. Register ownership securely
5. Maintain privacy while ensuring authenticity

## API Reference

The system provides REST APIs for integration with existing gemological laboratory systems and marketplace platforms:

- `POST /api/stone/register` - Register a new gemstone
- `GET /api/stone/:id` - Get gemstone registration details
- `POST /api/lab/certify` - Submit laboratory certification
- `GET /api/lab/:stoneId` - Get laboratory verification details
- `POST /api/treatment/disclose` - Document treatment procedures
- `GET /api/treatment/:stoneId` - Get treatment history
- `POST /api/ownership/transfer` - Record ownership change
- `GET /api/ownership/:stoneId` - Get ownership history

## Architecture

The system implements a hybrid architecture:
- On-chain: Core certification data, ownership records, and verification hashes
- Off-chain: High-resolution imagery, detailed reports, and spectroscopic data (IPFS hashes stored on-chain)

Smart contracts use role-based access control to ensure only authorized entities (accredited labs, registered dealers) can modify certification records.

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for high-value gemstone transfers
- Time-locked transitions for transaction settlement
- Integration with physical security features (micro-etching, nanotags)
- Privacy-preserving techniques for sensitive ownership data
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with IoT sensors for real-time tracking
- AI-powered anomaly detection for fraud prevention
- Mobile verification apps for consumers
- Marketplace integration for certified gemstones
- Insurance premium calculation based on certification data
